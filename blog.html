    <h2> Project 1 (9/26/2016)</h2>
         <p>Project one conissted of several elements to the assignment. To start there was signing up
         for a variety of web sites. This part of the assignment was not hard and did not take much effort.
         The next part of th assignment was demoing gitHub and git. This was a big more of a challenge for me.
         I've never worked with git or github. Initially I had a hard time understading and using basic funcionality.
         also had a hard time understanding why you would want to use gitHub. After struggling for a bit
         did some reaserch on git and gitHub. Mostly i tried to understand what it was really for.
         Once i understood the big picture it was much easier for me to understand use the basic functionality.</p>
          <p></p>
            <p>The next part of the assignment was writing the HTML for the blog and index pages. I did not
            find this difficult. I have not had much expirence with HTML but HTML just isn't that complicated.
            after a few hours going throuhgh this weeks readings I found it easy to write index and blog.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> The final part of the project and probably the most challenging for me was getting my page uploaded
            and published. Getting it uploaded to gitHub was easy as they provide lots of tools to make that easy.
	    The hard part trying to figure out how to VPN into the school network from home and upload my files to
	    the osu servers. However the egineering page gave me lots of usefull tools to help make this possible
	    after several hours of fiddileing with my pages i was able to get them to work.</p>
