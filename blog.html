    <h2> Project 1 (9/26/2016)</h2>
         <p>Project one conissted of several elements to the assignment. To start there was signing up
         <p>for a variety of web sites. This part of the assignment was not hard and did not take much effort.</p>
         <p>The next part of th assignment was demoing gitHub and git. This was a big more of a challenge for me.</p>
         <p>I've never worked with git or github. Initially I had a hard time understading and using basic funcionality.</p>
         <p>also had a hard time understanding why you would want to use gitHub. After struggling for a bit</P>
         <p>did some reaserch on git and gitHub. Mostly i tried to understand what it was really for.</p>
         <p>Once i understood the big picture it was much easier for me to understand use the basic functionality.</p>
          <p></p>
           <p> The next part of the assignment was writing the HTML for the blog and index pages. I did not</p>
            <p> find this difficult. I have not had much expirence with HTML but HTML just isn't that complicated.</p>
            <p> after a few hours going throuhgh this weeks readings I found it easy to write index and blog.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> The final part of the project and probably the most challenging for me was getting my page uploaded</p>
            <p> and published.</p>
